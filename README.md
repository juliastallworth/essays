IAGO</br>
I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</br>
To show the love and duty that I bear you</br>
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,</br>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</br>
<j>Look to<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></j> your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</br>
Wear your eyes thus, <j>not jealous nor secure.<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></j></br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,</br>
Out of <j>self-bounty<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></j>, <j>be abused<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></j>. <span style="color: lightblue;"><j>Look to ’t<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></j>.</br>
I know our <j>country<sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></j> disposition well.</br>
In Venice they do let God see the pranks</br>
They dare not show their husbands. Their best</br>
conscience</span></br>
Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.</p>

Commentary: This is where Iago first introduces the idea that Desdemona might be cheating on Othello with Cassio. This implantation of this idea into Othello's mind allows him to now be questioning Desdemona's character when he had not done so before. This form of manipulation relates to the idea of changing a person's beliefs by making insinuations, raising suspicions within the victim in order to mislead the victim into reinforcing false beliefs. Iago's form of manipulation allows him to to take control of Othello's emotions.

Commentary: Othello is a character that is swayed by his emotions, especially by the emotion of love. He relies heavily on people's trust and what they believe. Take Desdemona for example, Othello is so deeply in love that he puts all his trust in her, giving the opportunity or power to us that trust against him, but Desdemona does not do that. In contrast Iago takes full advantage of Othello's blinding trust and his emotions in order to obtain what he wants  through manipulation. Iago constantly refers back to his love for Othello in order to reinforce the idea of trust between him and Othello, so that Othello truly believes his words.

Commentary:  Before Othello's manipulation Othello has full confidence in Desdemona's love and loyalty, but now that Iago has taken advantage of Othello's emotion Othello begins to sway in his beliefs. His shifting beliefs is shown at the end of the passage when he says "And yet, how nature erring from itself" because his original thoughts above that line about Desdemona are now changed because he is now saying that a person can act against their own nature. When Othello says his last line Shakespeare is showcasing irony because Othello is beginning to accuse Desdemona for acting out of character based on the lies Iago is feeding him. The ironic part is Othello is also acting out of character through Iago's manipulation because now his emotions have changed and his beliefs are not longer the same, which results to his manic behavior later in the play (foreshadowing). </section> </p>
